# homework4 — Graph Analysis

Short repository for a graph analysis homework assignment. The primary script is `analysis.py`, which processes the CSV inputs in this folder and performs the analysis used for the assignment.

**Files**
- `analysis.py`: Main analysis script. Run this file to perform the analysis on the provided CSV inputs.
- `InputFileNodes.csv`: CSV containing the node data used by the analysis.
- `InputFileEdges.csv`: CSV containing the edge data used by the analysis.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.13).
- If `analysis.py` requires third-party packages, install them via `pip` (see the script header or comments for details).

**Usage**
Open a terminal in the repository root and run:

```powershell
python analysis.py
```

If you have multiple Python versions installed, run with the specific executable, for example:

```powershell
& C:\Path\To\python.exe analysis.py
```

**Input data**
- `InputFileNodes.csv`: Contains one row per node. Inspect the file to confirm column names and formats.
- `InputFileEdges.csv`: Contains edge relationships (e.g., source/target columns). Inspect the file to confirm column names and formats.

Notes:
- This README provides basic usage and file mapping for the assignment. If you want, I can extend it with example outputs, sample rows from the CSVs, or explicit dependency installation commands (`requirements.txt`).
